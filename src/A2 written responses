These two statements are the same because the both behave the same way. 
In both statements, the robot will eventually turn left because there is no 
action to make the robot turn right. So if it is told to turn right, it will 
not because it canâ€™t so it moves onto the next action, and if it is told to 
turn left it will ignore the right turn action.
